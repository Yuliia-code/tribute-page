                     <h2>A brief history of Dubai:</h2>
               <ul id="tribute-info">
               <li><strong>Establishment of modern Dubai:</strong> Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members. In 1833 members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty. In 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance.
            </li>
            <br>
               <li><strong>Pre-oil Dubai:</strong> Despite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport operators.
            </li>
            <br>
               <li><strong>Oil era:</strong> After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities.
                This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom.
                </li>
                <br>
               <li><strong>Reaching the UAE's Act of Union:</strong> On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following Iran's annexation of the RAK-claimed Tunbs islands.
                In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the UAE dirham.
                </li>
                <br>
               <li><strong>Modern Dubai:</strong> During the 1970s, Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war.
                Dubai airport and the aviation industry also continued to grow. Later on large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism which made Dubai one of the most desirable places to visit.
